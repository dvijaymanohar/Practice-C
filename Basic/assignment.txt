The second to last line of output is

my_int /= 2 : 32

In this example, 65 divided by 2 using the /= operator results in 32, not 32.5. This is because both operands, 65 and 2, are integers, type int, and when /= operates on two integers, it produces an integer result. This example only uses integer values, since that is how the numbers are declared. To get the fractional answer, you would have had to declare the three numbers involved as floats.

The last line of output is

my_int %= 3 : 2

This is because 32 divided by 3 is 10 with a remainder of 2.
