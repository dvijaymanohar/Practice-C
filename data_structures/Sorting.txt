Bubble Sort

This is one of the sorting techniques (but most infamous). It is an exchange sort, where 
it involves repeated comparisions of adjacent elements. In this sort, each element is like
bubbles in the water tank, each seeks its own level.

//Bubble Sort Source Listing 1
	for (i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--)
		for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
			if (a[j] < a[j - 1]) {
				temp = a[j];
				a[j] = a[j - 1];
				a[j - 1] = temp;
			}
		}

The outer loop causes the array to be scanned n -1 times. This loop ensures each element 
to go to the correct place when the function terminates. Inner loop is the one which performs
the actual exchanges and comparisons.

//Bubble Sort Source Listing 2
	for (i = 1; i < size; i++)
		for (j = size - 1; j >= i; j--) {
			if (a[j] < a[j - 1]) {
				temp = a[j];
				a[j] = a[j - 1];
				a[j - 1] = temp;
			}
		}

The peformance of a sorting is judged by the no of exchanges, comparisons the technique makes
in the best, average and worst cases.
